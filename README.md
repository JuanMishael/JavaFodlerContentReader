## Getting Started

the purpose of this progrm is to read all the content file inside a folder so you can just copy the name without manually copying it one by one if ever theres a ton of files. very useful when you're importing photo's to your web page.

Discalimer:
i do not own this program and all the credits belong to the owner,  i just revice some of its code for my own personal purposes


## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `ListofFiletoScan` :  this is where you place all the file you want to scan
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies


## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).
